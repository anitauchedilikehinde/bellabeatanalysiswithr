Data source: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data kaggle link.
Data was downloaded as a zip file containing 18 datasets of daily, hourly and minute steps, calorie and intensities data from 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data. The data was collected via a distributed survey by Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12th April 2016 and 12th May 2016. Data was stored locally. The datasets were organized in wide and long formats.

Credibility and Bias
Research was conducted by Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is a reliable conductor of surveys and simple data validation (among others). Survey participants are authorized Amazon MTurk workers who own a FitBit. This presents a sampling bias because knowing as well as being accepted to become a worker on this platform and participating in this particular Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) already excludes a large amount of people. Completed HITs also have to be accepted by the “Turker”, the criteria for acceptance is not outlined in the study. Also, eventhough MTurk workers are ethnically diverse, MTurk workers tend to be younger, more educated and lower on the income scale. Most workers are from US and India. This is not representative of US or general population according to this. Apart from this, the data collection is credible as datapoints are collected by FitBit which is largely automated and not subject to human error

Licensing and privacy:
The participants explicitly shared their data to participate in the study.

Relevance of the data:
The datasets contained data on daily/hourly/minute activity, calories, steps and intensities as well as data on sleep. These are relevant to the objective of the study.
